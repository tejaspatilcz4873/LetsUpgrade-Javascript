                         ASSIGNMENT 1
 
Q2) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR, LET ,CONST.

* VAR- 1)var is a functioned scope when it is declared outside function 
     2) var will be declared anywhere in the block 

eg  var name = " hello" 

    function newfunction(){
      var hello = "hello";
    }    

* Let -1) anything in the curly bracket is block and let is local varible.
       2) let is only work in a particular scope 

eg  function node simplified(){4
    let a=10;
    console.log(a);//output 10
    if(true){
    let a=20;
    console.log(a);//output 20
    }
    console.log(a);//output 10
    }  

* const - 1) const statement values can be assined once and they cannot be reassined 
    
eg  function nodesimplified(){
    const MY-VARIABLE =10;
    console.log(MY-VARIABLE);//output 10
    }
