                               ASSIGNMENT 1

QUESTION 3 INTRO ON AVAILABLE DATATYPES IN JAVASCRIPT

1) SYMBOL- A symbol is unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an object
           property . In some progemiing lang symbol are called atoms.

2) OBJECT- In computer science , an object is a value in memory is possibly referenced by an identifier.

3) STRING TYPE- In jvascript string type is used to represnt textual data . It is a set of elements of 16 bits unsigned integer value . 
                Each element in string  occupies  a position in the string .the first element is at index 0 the next at index 1
                The length ofa string is the of elements in it.javascript string are immutable this means that once a string is 
                created , it is not possible to modify it.

4) BigInt TYPE- The BigInt type is numeric primitive in js that can represnt integers with arbitary precision .with BigInt you can 
                safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for no.
                A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the constructor.

5) Number type - The number type is double precision 64 bit binary format IEEE value In addition to represnting 
                 floating point no ,the number type has three symbolic  values 
                 1 + Infinity 2 -Infinity 3 NaN

6) BOOLEAN TYPE - Boolean represents  logical entity and can have two values that is true and false.

7) NULL TYPE- the null type is exactly one value null .

8) UNDEFINED TYPE -A variable that has not been assined a value has the value undefined .
